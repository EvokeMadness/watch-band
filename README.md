## Bill of Materials

- One watch body
- Two watch spring bars
- One watch strap buckle

## Assembly

- Insert one spring bar through the hole located at the wider part of each strap, ensuring the bars are evenly through the widths of the straps.
- Depress the spring bar attached to the adjustment strap and place it into the lower strap slot on the watch body.
- Slide the strap loop over the buckle strap.
- Separate the watch strap buckle into three parts.
- Ensure the buckle strap is facing in the same direction as it was printed, with the detailed side facing up.
- Insert the spring bar from left to right through the first knuckle on the strap.
- Place the watch strap buckle tongue after the first knuckle, ensuring the end of the tongue terminates down.
- Push the spring bar through the tongue and second knuckle, ensuring the bar is evenly through the width of the strap.
- Depress the spring bar and clasp the buckle onto the buckle end of the strap. Ensure that the buckle tongue is above the buckle, and that the buckle terminates down.
- Depress the spring bar attached to the buckle strap and place it into the upper strap slot on the watch body.

### Troubleshooting

If the vertical shells delaminates along the watch strap sides, try adjusting the Infill/perimeters overlap. I recommend setting this value between `75%` and `100%`. This setting can be found under the following:
